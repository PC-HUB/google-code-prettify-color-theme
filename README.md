### How to use
1. Add following script right above the closing `</body>` tag

`<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/google/code-prettify/master/loader/run_prettify.js"></script>`

2. Add `code-prettify-theme.css` in your page

3. Write your code between 
```
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    ...
</pre> 
```
to get Dark Highlighted code with line numbers. 
If you do not wish to add line numbers then you can simply remove `linenums` from 
```
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    ...
</pre> 
```

I've edited Sunburst theme to make it look more pretty and readable with cool line numbers. I hope you'll like it and you are free to edit/update this theme as per your needs :wink:
